# :keyboard: What is Keymeta

Keymeta is an innovative virtual keyboard for iOS that combines fast interactions with the power of the TON Blockchain. This revolutionary keyboard simplifies Web3 access in any app where you're typing, making it seamless to swap, earn and spend coins. Keymeta transforms the way users engage with decentralized technologies.

## Mission

Keymeta's mission is to onboard and educate the vast Web 2.0 user base into the world of Web3 through its exclusive partnership with TON. By leveraging the robust capabilities of the TON network, Keymeta is evolving into a comprehensive ecosystem where users can earn, swap and spend coins, providing seamless and engaging transition into Web3.


# :nerd_face: Typing

Keymeta gives the opportunity to earn tokens as you perform actions on the keyboard, making Web3 technologies accessible across your entire device -not just in specific apps- and facilitating broader adoption.

By rewarding the users for positive sentence, well written languages and actions we will be contributing to bring better mental health to the new generations while we transition them to decentralized technologies.

We have defined three main pillars to monitor going forward:
1. **Adoption**: Focus on driving Web3 technology implementation.
2. **Engagement&Distribution**: Reach the maximum usage possible.
3. **Behavioral Change**: Tap-to-earn is designed to boost your text output while rewarding positive thinking.
