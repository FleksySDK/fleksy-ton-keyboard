# :keyboard: What is Keymeta

Keymeta is an innovative virtual keyboard for iOS that combines fast interactions with the power of the TON Blockchain. This revolutionary keyboard simplifies Web3 access in any app where you're typing, making it seamless to swap, earn and spend coins. Keymeta transforms the way users engage with decentralized technologies.

## Mission

Keymeta's mission is to onboard and educate the vast Web 2.0 user base into the world of Web3 through its exclusive partnership with TON. By leveraging the robust capabilities of the TON network, Keymeta is evolving into a comprehensive ecosystem where users can earn, swap and spend coins, providing seamless and engaging transition into Web3.


# :nerd_face: Typing

Keymeta gives the opportunity to earn tokens as you perform actions on the keyboard, making Web3 technologies accessible across your entire device -not just in specific apps- and facilitating broader adoption.

By rewarding the users for positive sentence, well written languages and actions we will be contributing to bring better mental health to the new generations while we transition them to decentralized technologies.

We have defined three main pillars to monitor going forward:
1. **Adoption**: Focus on driving Web3 technology implementation.
2. **Engagement&Distribution**: Reach the maximum usage possible.
3. **Behavioral Change**: Tap-to-earn is designed to boost your text output while rewarding positive thinking.

# Features

**Tap-to-Earn**

The concept of the tap-to-earn is an innovate way to incentive the user to use Web3 technologies while we increase the usage, reward positive thinking and generate revene.

**Swap**

Once the user has connected their wallet and we begin rewarding them with our native coins on the TON Network, we will introduce a swap feature, allowing users to exchange our coins for other cryptocurrencies.

**Secure clipboard**

As an additional feature, a secure clipboard for storing wallet addresses and other keys will be essential in providing the TON community with a high level of security, convenience and trust.

**TON Technology**

In this case we have been using:
1. TonConnect for the wallet integration
2. TON SDK for blockchain interactions

**Know Your Customer**

In order to validate that the user is a real user, to prevent fraud on the tap-to-earn system, we will be using a system in development to know if the keyboard is used by a machine or by a human.

**How KeyMeta Works: An Example**

The KeyMeta app for iOS allows you to connect to your own wallet -- in this example, we will use TonKeeper. Once the wallet is connected, you can continue typing using the KeyMeta keyboard. As you type, the app tracks certain behavioural parameters from your keystrokes. These parameters help us verify that the user behind the keyboard is indeed a human, not a bot.

For this demonstration, we will type a random string of text. After completing the text entry, we return to the app itself to validate that a real person typed the message, based on the tracked keystroke data.

Once confirmed, the system proceeds to reward the user with our native coin, called `KMC`. The reward is then processed through the Ton Network, transferring the KMC coins directly to your connected wallet.

For this example, the reward is 0.01 KMC per keyboard session.
